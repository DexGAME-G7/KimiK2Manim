I am a highschool teacher and I want to make the connection between the random pertuburbations of pollen particls that robert brown saw under his microscope, and then conceptually connect and artistically visualize the connection to the random vibration of subataomic particles, what we know as heat, and how einstein ultiamtelly connected that to his heat equation. 



Take 2 mintues to explain these concepts with on screen latex formulas and visual renderings that correctly teach these disparate concepts.
